# Marco's OBA Adventure

## 3 important things
### What makes me proud
The backend server is up and running.

### Where am I stuck
I don't get Heroku to work because the server folder is not my real root folder.

### How did I solve a problem
The service worker was hard for me because it was new for me. But with the presentation of Declan I was able to fix it.

### Demo:
I was not able to get Heroku working.

### Description
I can remember the days as a child when I was bored in the beginning of a project. I was always playing with my mouse on the monitor instead of the things I was supposed to do, that is why I decided to make this application to motivate children by make it easier and more fun for them to pick a subject for their project.

### What API did I use
I made use of the OBA Api, you can make 200 request an hour before you have to change the URL of the website to make it work again.
