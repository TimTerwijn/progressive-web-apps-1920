# Marco's OBA Adventure

## 3 important things
### What makes me proud
The backend server is up and running.

### Where am I stuck
I don't get Heroku to work because the server folder is not my real root folder.

### How did I solve a problem
The service worker was hard for me because it was new for me. But with the presentation of Declan I was able to fix it.

### Demo:
I was not able to get Heroku working.

### Description
I can remember the days as a child when I was bored in the beginning of a project. I was always playing with my mouse on the monitor instead of the things I was supposed to do, that is why I decided to make this application to motivate children by make it easier and more fun for them to pick a subject for their project.

### What API did I use
I made use of the OBA Api, you can make 200 request an hour before you have to change the URL of the website to make it work again.  

Example of a record:

### Critical Rendering Path

The first improvement that I made was implementing progressive rendering. This way the page was loaded in this order:  
1. The doctype + HTML
2. The header combined with the css
3. The body with everything exept for the results and the clientside javascript
4. The clientside javascript because the results can take awhile to load, especially images.

5. The results.
6. Finally close the grid, body and HTML.  

You can see that this gave me a loading speed boost in the image below, because the HTML, CSS and JS files are rendering during the time the server is looking for the results.

### Roadmap
* Make App Responsive
* Marco jumps after event not before
* Write arrow tutorial to move Marco.
